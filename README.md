# Omani-Voice-Only-Chatbot
A voice-only conversational AI designed to provide empathetic and culturally-aware mental health support in the Omani Arabic dialect. It leverages a dual-model architecture using GPT-4o for primary responses and Claude Opus 4 for real-time validation to ensure therapeutic and cultural accuracy. The entire pipeline, from speech-to-text to response synthesis, is handled by Azure Speech Services and presented in a Gradio web interface.
## Features

**Voice-Only Interaction:** Real-time, human like conversation.

**Authentic Omani Dialect:** Utilizes Azure's `ar-OM` and `en-US` for multi-language support and speech recognition for a natural feel.

**Dual-Model Architecture:** **GPT-4o** for initial response generation. **Claude Opus 4** for parallel validation of gpt's response, ensuring cultural and therapeutic safety.

**Context-Aware Memory:** Implements a rolling summary mechanism to maintain long-term context in conversations.

**Gradio Web Interface:** Simple and accessible UI for demonstration.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** Python

**Web UI:** Gradio

**LLMs:** OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude Opus 4)

**Speech Services:** Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (STT & TTS)
